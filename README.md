# Child Mortality in South Asia
Data visualization and discriptive analysis of patterns of child mortality in southern Asia.

Data taken from Kaggle.com.

I delve into the relationships between changes in child mortality over several decades, and healthcare spending, hygiene situations, disease prevelance etc. in seven different countries in South Asia. I try to understand their correlations and the most important factors that influence under-5 mortality in this region.

The data file is too big to upload here. Find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gargimaheshwari/child-mortality-in-south-asia/data) under 'Indicators.csv'.
