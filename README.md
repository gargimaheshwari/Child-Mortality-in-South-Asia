# Child Mortality in South Asia
Data visualization and discriptive analysis of patterns of child mortality in southern Asia.

Data taken from Kaggle.com.

I delve into the relationships between changes in child mortality over several decades, and healthcare spending, hygiene situations, disease prevelance etc. in seven different countries in South Asia. I try to understand their correlations and the most important factors that influence under-5 mortality in this region.
